# Computer Science Blog
This is my personal blog, I write about computer science topics, 
mostly about machine learning. This blog is connected to dev.to through 
its api. Almost every week I upload a new post on dev.to, after that 
the web updates automatically. 

The web page is hosted on AWS Amplify and it is made with React, one of 
the libraries I love the most. I made this website to 
contain and list all my posts without all the mess that a social network 
has.
